trade
-----
**trade** implements a paradigm for financial apps where the operations
themselves (called *occurrences*) are objects responsible for updating
the state of an asset holder every time they occur.

The asset holder state at a given timestamp may be loaded from a source
(like a database) and then updated with a series of occurrences - raw 
operation data loaded as *Occurrence* objects. This outputs a new state
for the *Holder*.

**trade** offers four classes: *Holder*, *Occurrence*, *Subject* and *Context*
and defines the basic structure for a context-independent financial app. These
classes should be extended according to the needs of the app.


It uses the concept of *holders*, *subjects*, *occurrences* and *contexts*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A *subject* is anything that can be traded.

A *holder* is someone who owns subjects.

A *holder* state is updated by *occurrences*.

*Occurrences* may happen alone or in *contexts*.


A *subject* is anything that can be traded
------------------------------------------
A *subject* may be the share of a corporation, livestock and so on.


A *holder* is a entity that owns subjects
-----------------------------------------
A *holder* owns subjects. The *holder* state is updated by occurrences.
A holder may hold none or many subjects.


*Occurrences* happen with subjects and change the state of the *holder*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A *occurrence* may be caused by the *holder*, like the purchase of units of some
*subject*. They can also represent other events, like a stock split.
In both cases they should change the state of the *holder*.


A *context* may have its own rules
----------------------------------
*Contexts* are groups of occurrences.

*Contexts* are used to pre-process occurrences before informing them to a *holder*.

A *context* may be a situation where daytrades should be identified, for example.

A *context* may also involve taxes and other costs altering the details of the occurrences.


Extending the framework
-----------------------
**trade** should be extended with new types of *occurrences*, *subjects* and *context rules*.

The *holder* state signature can be defined according to the needs of the application.


Live sample app
---------------
You can try it `live <https://python-trade.appspot.com>`_.

This is a **sample app** built with **trade**. It runs as a service.

The input is a JSON with *occurrences* and a initial state
for the *holder*.

The sample app have *context tasks* to **identify daytrades** and more.

The service also calculates the **profits** and **losses** from the
occurrences and **groups the results** by asset.

The output is the *holder* state as a JSON.


Use:
----

.. code:: python

	from trade.holder import Holder
	from trade.occurrence import Occurrence
	from trade.subject import Subject

	# create a holder
	holder = Holder()

	# define some subject
	some_asset = Subject('AST1')

	# create an occurrence with that subject.
	# In this example, a purchase of 100 units of the asset,
	# for the value of $20.
	some_occurrence = Occurrence(
			some_asset,
			'2018-01-02',
			{
				"quantity": 100,
				"value": 20
			}
		)

	# pass it to the holder
	holder.trade(some_occurrence)

	# check the holder state:
	for subject, state in holder.state.items():
		print(subject)
		print(state)
	# AST1
	# {'value': 20.0, 'quantity': 100}

Updating the holder state with a new occurrence:

.. code:: python

	# create some other occurrence with that subject.
	# In this example, a sale of 20 units of the asset,
	# for the value of $30.
	holder.trade(Occurrence(
			some_asset,
			'2018-01-03',
			{
				"quantity": -20,
				"value": 30
			}
		))

	# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity
	# and some profit:
	for subject, state in holder.state.items():
		print(subject)
		print(state)
	# AST1
	# {'value': 20.0, 'quantity': 80}

More occurrences:

.. code:: python

	# create some other occurrence with that subject.
	# Now a purchase of 10 units of the asset, for the
	# value of $20.
	holder.trade(Occurrence(
			some_asset,
			'2018-01-04',
			{
				"quantity": 10,
				"value": 25
			}
		))

	# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity
	# and in the value of the subject:
	for subject, state in holder.state.items():
		print(subject)
		print(state)
	# AST1
	# {'value': 20.555555555555557, 'quantity': 90}
